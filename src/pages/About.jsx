          <p className="fs-4" style={{textAlign: "justify"}}>The project understands the existing gaps in collating and recognizing citizens’ inputs in budgets, the awareness of citizens on budget monitoring despite the existence of open contracting data portals, and poor knowledge of the importance of paying fair amounts of taxes. The project focuses on the development objective of strengthening citizens’ participation and social accountability in fiscal transparency, procurement, and IGR monitoring in Adamawa State. The project builds the capacity and supports state and non-state actors. The project assesses where the target locations are left behind, strengthens where it is weak, and institutionalizes where it is strong using the principles of inclusivity, co-creation, transparency, accountability, and effectiveness in Public Finance Management (PFM). The project will give a particular emphasis to nominating budget and monitoring projects that will translate to improved delivery of public services in basic education, primary health care, and water, sanitation, and hygiene [WASH].</p>

One in each state senatorial zone - Michika in the Northern Senatorial Zone, Ganye in the Southern Senatorial Zone, and Yola North in the Central Senatorial Zone of Adamawa State. The project works with the communities to build their capacities to prioritize their needs on budget lines that will improve service delivery, identify these projects from the budgets, and monitor them to implementation through the open contracting data. The project also works with the state’s Open Government Partnership Structure by keying and promoting the two thematic areas of fiscal transparency and citizen engagement. The selected local governments are built to serve as models and learning grounds for replication across the other local governments.</p>

With governments, the project provides technical assistance to participating government parastatals to co-build and sustain citizens engagement initiatives that stand in for improved service delivery in basic education, primary health care, and water, sanitation, and hygiene [WASH] in the most transparent, accountable and inclusive (youth, women, and persons with disabilities) way, with focus on fiscal planning, budget preparation and approval, procurement award and implementation and evaluation—processes that build stronger revenue generation, budgeting and procurement systems. While with citizens, the project shall utilize already existing platforms like community leaders, civil society networks, youth, women, and PWD groups while utilizing global initiatives like the Open Government Partnership (OGP) to build their capacity and awareness to ensure sustainability.</p>
